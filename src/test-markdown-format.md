# Sample Markdown Document for Testing

## Document Summary

This document analyzes the recent changes in **Nepal Financial Reporting Standards (NFRS)** with a focus on financial instruments.

### Key Points:

1. NFRS 9 replaces NAS 39 for financial instrument accounting
2. New classification categories:
   - Amortized cost
   - Fair value through other comprehensive income
   - Fair value through profit or loss

> **Important Note:** Classification depends on both the business model and contractual cash flow characteristics.

### Sample Code for Impairment Calculation

```javascript
function calculateExpectedCreditLoss(exposure, probability, lossGiven) {
  return exposure * probability * lossGiven;
}

// Example usage
const ecl = calculateExpectedCreditLoss(1000000, 0.05, 0.6);
console.log(`Expected Credit Loss: NPR ${ecl}`);
```
