## Tips for Financial Statement Tables

1. **Use Bold Headings**: Use `**bold**` for section headers to improve readability
2. **Align Numbers**: Keep numbers right-aligned in their cells
3. **Include Empty Rows**: Add empty rows (using `|    |    |`) between sections
4. **Show Negative Numbers**: Use parentheses for negative numbers: `(10,000)`
5. **Maintain Consistency**: Keep column widths consistent throughout the table
6. **Use Indentation**: Use characters like `-` or `路` for hierarchical relationships

These examples follow standard accounting presentation formats while maintaining compatibility with markdown rendering in the NFRS Assistant.
